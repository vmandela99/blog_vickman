::: {#hero-heading}
Hi! My name is Victor Mandela from Kenya ðŸ’œ.

I'm a data enthusiast and statistics warrior, and I strive in environments that need solutions related to data research.

I have been writing about R in my blog since 2019. I'm mostly active in the ShinyR and tidyverse community, slack groups and social media sites.

I hold an MSc in Statistics from the University of Nairobi. My research I am majorly interested in webApp development, machine learning and evidence-based reproducible research.
