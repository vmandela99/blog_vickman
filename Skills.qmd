**Welcome to My Skills Overview!** üåü

As a researcher and data scientist with years of experience across various fields, I bring a diverse set of skills to every project. Below, you‚Äôll find an overview of my key skills organized into specific categories. Whether it's using advanced machine learning techniques, conducting in-depth data analysis, or delivering high-quality research, my goal is to turn data into actionable insights.

Explore my skill sets, from **Data Science** to **Monitoring & Evaluation**, and discover the tools and methodologies that power my work. Each section includes examples of real-world projects, tutorials, and hands-on case studies.

**Here‚Äôs a brief snapshot of my core competencies:**

1.  <div>

    ### 1. **Data Science & Analytics** üìä

    </div>

    -   **Expertise**: Advanced proficiency in R, Python, and STATA for statistical analysis and data visualization.

    -   **Focus Areas**: Machine learning (e.g., neural networks, ensemble models), predictive modeling, data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis.

    -   **Tools**: Proficient in using libraries such as `tidymodels`, `pandas`, and `ggplot2`, and tools like Tableau and Excel for visual storytelling.

    -   **Example Projects**: My work on "Ensemble Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Drought Severity in Isiolo County" demonstrates my ability to apply sophisticated models to solve real-world problems.

    ### 2. **Research Methods** üìö

    -   **Quantitative & Qualitative**: Expertise in survey design, sampling methods, regression analysis, and qualitative methods (focus groups, interviews).

    -   **Data Collection Tools**: Skilled in using tools such as ODK, KoboCollect, and Google Forms to collect and manage high-quality data.

    -   **Software**: Proficient with NVivo and ATLAS.ti for qualitative data analysis, ensuring meaningful insights are derived from complex datasets.

    -   **Applied Work**: In my role as a Research Analyst at Population Council, I applied these methods to design and implement large-scale studies, ensuring rigor in both data collection and analysis.

    ### 3. **Programming** üíª

    -   **Languages**: Extensive experience in R, Python, SQL, and familiarity with Shiny for creating interactive data applications.

    -   **Automation & Optimization**: Automating data processes, building custom models, and streamlining workflows for data-driven decision-making.

    -   **Portfolio Website Services**: I also offer website portfolio services for researchers and data scientists to showcase their skills and projects, as part of my professional offerings.

    -   **Open Source Projects**: I actively contribute to the data science community through GitHub, sharing code repositories and projects for collaborative learning.

    ### 4. **Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)** üîç

    -   **Frameworks & Methodologies**: I have extensive experience in **developing and implementing M&E frameworks**, particularly for **social programs** and **public health interventions**. This includes **logic models**, **results frameworks**, and **theories of change** to assess program performance.

    -   **Quantitative & Qualitative M&E**: Expertise in **baseline and endline surveys**, monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), and using **mixed methods** (quantitative and qualitative) to deliver comprehensive evaluations. I‚Äôve worked with both traditional M&E tools (surveys, focus groups) and advanced techniques like **counterfactual impact evaluations** to measure program efficacy.

    -   **Data Collection & Analysis Tools**: Proficient in tools such as **ODK**, **KoboCollect**, **SPSS**, and **STATA** for real-time data collection and analysis. My expertise extends to using R and Python for analyzing large datasets to identify trends, patterns, and program outcomes.

    -   **Sectoral Expertise**: My M&E experience spans sectors such as **early childhood development**, **public health**, and **peace and conflict assessment**. In a recent project, I was involved in a peace and conflict assessment in Kenya and Sudan, analyzing data on youth engagement in conflict zones.

    -   **Real-World Projects**: I‚Äôve led M&E efforts for a variety of organizations, including conducting **baseline and endline evaluations** for programs aimed at **young mothers** and **early childhood development** at ICRW Africa. This has involved everything from designing surveys to leading data collection efforts and presenting findings to key stakeholders.

    -   **Capacity Building**: I‚Äôve also been responsible for **training teams** and **building capacity** within organizations, ensuring that M&E practices are sustainable and scalable. Through workshops and hands-on training, I empower teams to implement their own M&E processes.

    -   **Reporting & Communication**: Skilled at translating complex evaluation results into actionable insights for stakeholders. I create clear, concise reports that are both data-driven and accessible to a broad audience, ensuring decision-makers have the information they need to improve program outcomes.
