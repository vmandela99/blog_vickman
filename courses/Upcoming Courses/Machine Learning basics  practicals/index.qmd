<span style="color:#800080; font-weight:bold;">🤖 Machine Learning for Humanitarian Practical Data 🌍</span>

How can machine learning be used to improve humanitarian outcomes? From early warning systems for food insecurity to predicting disease outbreaks and optimizing aid distribution, ML is changing how we address real-world challenges.

We’re thrilled to announce our new course:

🎓 Machine Learning for Humanitarian Practical Data
A beginner-to-intermediate level course focused on building practical ML skills using real humanitarian datasets.

<span style="color:#800080; font-weight:bold;">💡 Why This Course?</span>

Machine learning can feel overwhelming—especially in sectors like health, education, climate resilience, and crisis response where clean, structured data is rare. This course bridges that gap by teaching machine learning with noisy, messy, real-world data, just like what you work with on the ground.

No more theory-only learning. You'll gain hands-on experience applying ML to humanitarian and development datasets that matter.

<span style="color:#800080; font-weight:bold;">🎯 Course Objectives</span>

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

✅ Understand the ML workflow: from data preparation to model evaluation
✅ Explore key ML algorithms: regression, classification, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble models
✅ Handle missing data, imbalance, and data quality issues in humanitarian datasets
✅ Evaluate model performance with real metrics
✅ Use tools like caret, tidymodels, and xgboost in R
✅ Communicate ML findings through compelling visuals and reports
