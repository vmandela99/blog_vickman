## 🤖 Machine Learning for Humanitarian Practical Data 🌍

**How can machine learning be used to improve humanitarian outcomes?** From early warning systems for food insecurity to predicting disease outbreaks and optimizing aid distribution, ML is changing how we address real-world challenges.

We’re thrilled to announce our new course:

🎓 **Machine Learning for Humanitarian Practical Data** – A beginner-to-intermediate level course focused on building **practical ML skills** using **real humanitarian datasets**.

### 💡 Why This Course?

Machine learning can feel overwhelming—especially in sectors like **health**, **education**, **climate resilience**, and **crisis response** where clean, structured data is rare. This course bridges that gap by teaching machine learning **with noisy, messy, real-world data**, just like what you work with on the ground.

No more theory-only learning. You'll gain hands-on experience applying ML to **humanitarian and development datasets** that matter.

### 🎯 Course Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

✅ Understand the ML workflow: from data preparation to model evaluation\
✅ Explore key ML algorithms: regression, classification, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble models\
✅ Handle missing data, imbalance, and data quality issues in humanitarian datasets\
✅ Evaluate model performance with real metrics\
✅ Use tools like `caret`, `tidymodels`, and `xgboost` in R\
✅ Communicate ML findings through compelling visuals and reports

### 🎁 Free Pre-Course Webinar 🎙️
