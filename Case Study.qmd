    </div>

    ### **Project Overview**

    In 2023, I led an endline evaluation for a family planning program targeting **girls aged 15 to 24 years** in Kenya. The program aimed to increase the awareness and use of modern contraceptive methods among young women, focusing on improving reproductive health outcomes in both urban and rural settings. The evaluation involved conducting **client exit interviews** to gather feedback from girls immediately after they accessed family planning services.

    ### **Objectives**

    -   **Measure Contraceptive Uptake**: To assess the uptake of modern family planning methods among girls aged 15-24 after program implementation.

    -   **Identify Barriers**: To understand the specific barriers and challenges faced by this age group in accessing and using family planning methods.

    -   **Evaluate Service Satisfaction**: To evaluate the quality of family planning services provided and the satisfaction levels of the young clients.

    ### **Methodology**

    The evaluation utilized **Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling** to ensure a representative sample of health facilities and clients. This approach allowed us to capture diverse data from both urban and rural areas across Kenya.

    1.  **Sampling & Data Collection**:

        -   **PPS Sampling**: Health facilities were selected based on the size of their patient population, ensuring a representative distribution across different regions.

        -   **Exit Interviews**: Conducted with **450 girls** aged 15 to 24 immediately after they received family planning services at selected facilities. Interviews focused on contraceptive choice, awareness, and overall experience.

        -   **Data Analysis**: Quantitative data was analyzed using **SPSS** to determine the uptake rates and identify trends.

    2.  **Qualitative Insights**:

        -   **In-Depth Interviews**: Follow-up qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of clients and healthcare providers to gather deeper insights into the barriers and facilitators of family planning among young women.

        -   **Analysis Tools**: NVivo was used for qualitative coding to extract themes related to client experiences and service quality.

    ### **Key Findings**

    -   **Increased Uptake**: The program led to a **35% increase** in the use of modern contraceptives among girls aged 15-24. The most commonly used methods included **oral contraceptives** and **implants**.

    -   **Awareness**: **68% of the interviewed girls** reported a significant increase in their knowledge about available contraceptive options and their benefits.

    -   **Barriers Identified**: Despite the increase in uptake, **28% of girls** identified barriers such as **stigma**, **lack of privacy**, and **limited access** to services in rural areas as ongoing challenges.

    ### **Challenges**

    -   **Stigma and Privacy Concerns**: Many young women reported feeling embarrassed or stigmatized when seeking family planning services, which affected their willingness to use available resources. This was more pronounced in rural areas where traditional views on contraception are stronger.

    -   **Service Accessibility**: Although the program improved service access, some girls in remote areas still faced difficulties in reaching health facilities due to **transportation issues** and **inconsistent service availability**.

    ### **Impact & Recommendations**

    The endline evaluation demonstrated that the program effectively increased contraceptive uptake among young women. However, several areas need further attention:

    -   **Enhancing Privacy**: Implement strategies to ensure privacy and reduce stigma around family planning services, such as confidential counseling and private service delivery spaces.

    -   **Improving Access**: Expand outreach efforts and mobile clinics to reach more remote and underserved areas, addressing transportation and logistical barriers.

    -   **Community Engagement**: Increase community-based education and engage influential community members to address cultural and social barriers to family planning.

    ### **Conclusion**

    The exit interviews provided valuable insights into the impact of the family planning program on young women in Kenya. By focusing on this specific age group, the evaluation highlighted the successes of the program while identifying key challenges that need to be addressed to further improve family planning services and accessibility for girls aged 15-24.
