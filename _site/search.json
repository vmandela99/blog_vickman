    "title": "Getting Weather Data via API with R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I came across this awesome post from Albert Rapp about how to get weather data from API and I thought it was a great technique to use. Here we go.\n\nWhat is an API?\nWe are focusing on two APIs (application programming interfaces) for our project. Broadly speaking, an API is anything that we can throw code at to get results that we want.\nOften this refers to some data source that we tap into. But sometimes it also simply means the syntax of code. For example, ggplot2 has a very distinctive API, i.e. a code syntax to create a chart.\nIn our current case, we will just refer to APIs as data sources and we will need to tap into two such APIs, namely these ones:\n\nUS National Weather Service API\nGoogle Geocoding API\n\nThe first one will give us weather forecasts based on specified coordinates and the second one will turn any address into coordinates for us. Today, we’ll focus on the first one.\n\n\nMaking requests to an API\nIf you’ve never worked with APIs, you know that it can feel like data is hidden away behind an API. Thankfully, the {httr2} package helps us a lot, even if we’ve never dealt with APIs before.\nCase in point, my fellow YouTubeR (see what I did there? it’s “YouTube” and “R”) Melissa Van Bussel put together an excellent video that shows you how to use {httr2} to call the API of openAI or GitLab.\nAnyway, here’s how to make a request to an API to get data:\n\nNavigate to the URL the data can be accessed from\n(Optional depending on the API) Authenticate\nGet the response\n\nWith the National Weather Service, you can easily try this yourself. Just head to the following url using your web browser:\nhttps://api.weather.gov/points/38.8894,-77.0352\nIf you navigate there, you will get cryptic data like that:\n\nThis is what is known as a JSON file. More on that later. For now, notice that what you see at the end of the url after points/ corresponds to the coordinates that are given in the JSON output.\nThis means that the recipe for calling the weather API is simple: Append points/{lat},{long} at the end of the base_url, i.e. https://api.weather.gov/. In this case, {lat},{long} corresponds to the latitude and longitude of the location you want to get weather forecasts for.\n\n\nMaking a request with {httr2}\nThe {httr2} syntax to make this work mimics this quite well. Here’s how it looks.\n\nBasically, at the core of every request is the request() function that needs to know the base_url. This returns an &lt;httr2_request&gt; object that can be passed to further req_*() functions to modify the request.\nHere, we used req_url_path_append() to modify the request but there are also other functions (and next week we’ll learn about req_url_query()). Finally, to actually make the request, you can pass everything to req_perform().\n\n\n\nGetting the response\nAs you’ve just seen, your request will return a &lt;httr2_response&gt; and if everything went well, the output will also show you Status: 200 OK. You can get the actual content (the JSON that you’ve seen in your web browser earlier) via one of the many resp_*() functions that handle responses.\n\n\n\nWorking with the response\nAs you’ve seen in the output, the JSON file you receive is structured as a highly nested list. To make sense of this data, we use glimpse() to understand the structure of the object\n\nAnd with pluck() you can easily drill down into specific parts of the list. For example, this could be used to get the URL for the hourly forecasts\n\n\n\nRepeat process for forecasts\nWith the new forecast URL, we can get new JSON data about the forecasts for our location.\n\nIn that output, we can see that there is a list called periods inside of the properties list that contains lists which always have 16 entries. This might be where our forecast data lives.\n\nAha! Each of those 16-entries lists seem to correspond to the forecast of one hour. Thus, to get the things like temperature, startTime, probabilityOfPrecipitation, and short_forecast into a nice tibble format, we have to iterate over all of these 16-entries lists and wrap the values we want into a tibble.\n\nAnd once we have that data, we can transform the time column into a nice date-time object:\n\nThis was awesome. !"

In the vast terrain of the professional realm, where equations reign supreme and spreadsheets take center stage, it’s time to sprinkle a dash of humor onto the canvas of calculations. Join me on this delightful journey as we explore ways to enhance our mathematical and analytical prowess with a grin on our faces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace mathematics as the quirky companion in your cubicle. Inject humor into the daily grind of numbers. Consider math the office prankster – sometimes challenging, often surprising, but always ready to bring a smile to your face. Crack a math-related joke during coffee breaks and transform your numerical nemesis into a trusted ally.\nExample: “Why was the equal sign so humble? Because he knew he wasn't less than or greater than anyone else!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcel, the caped crusader of corporate calculation! Dive into the realm of formulas and functions fearlessly, like a hero facing down a villain. Master PivotTables, VLOOKUPs, and SUMIFS – wield them with the finesse of a mathematical ninja. Soon, your coworkers will marvel at your spreadsheet superpowers, making you the hero the office never knew it needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduce brain-teasing puzzles and games into your daily routine – because who said work can’t be fun? Sudoku, crosswords, and logic puzzles not only entertain but also supercharge your analytical thinking. Challenge your colleagues to friendly puzzle-solving competitions during breaks. The winner earns bragging rights and a metaphorical crown, turning the office into a playground of mental gymnastics.\n\n\n\nTransform mundane meetings into engaging sessions by incorporating brain teasers and quick math challenges. Kickstart discussions with a burst of intellectual energy. Not only will this sharpen everyone’s analytical skills, but it will also foster a collaborative and dynamic workplace.\nExample: Open your next meeting with a puzzle: “If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?” Watch as your colleagues’ brains kick into high gear!\n\n\n\nCharts and graphs need not be dull – let them be your canvas for creativity! Infuse a bit of humor into your data visualizations. Turn a line graph into a rollercoaster of success or transform a bar chart into a skyscraper of achievements. The more entertaining, the more memorable your insights become.\n\n\n\nIn the pursuit of mathematical and analytical excellence, don’t forget to have a bit of fun along the way. Whether you’re a seasoned number-cruncher or a math-phobic beginner, infusing humor into your calculations not only enhances your skills but also makes the workplace a more enjoyable space for everyone. So, put on your mathematical cape, embrace the numbers, and let the workplace be your stage for a comedy of calculations. Happy calculating!"

    "text": "Mastering the Art of Task Juggling: A Simple Guide to Prioritizing and Multi-Tasking\n\nIntroduction\nHello, task-tacklers! Whether you’re a seasoned professional or just diving into the busy world of responsibilities, we’ve got your back. In this guide, we’ll unravel the secrets behind prioritizing tasks and mastering the delicate dance of multi-tasking. So, let’s make this easy to understand for everyone, because everyone deserves a stress-free to-do list!\n1. “The Magic of Prioritizing: Sorting Your To-Do List”\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine your to-do list as a garden. Some tasks are delicate flowers needing immediate attention, while others are sturdy shrubs that can wait a bit. Prioritizing is like being a gardener – identify the high-priority blooms and nurture them first. Consider deadlines, importance, and impact to decide which tasks get the sunlight of your focus.\n2. “ABCs of Prioritization: High, Medium, Low”\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of tasks in terms of urgency and importance. Label them as high, medium, or low priority. Tackle the high-priority tasks first – they’re like the VIPs in your task list, demanding immediate attention. Once the VIPs are sorted, move on to the medium and low-priority tasks. This simple ABC strategy keeps your to-do list organized and manageable.\n3. “Multi-Tasking: A Symphony of Skills”\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-tasking is like conducting a symphony – each instrument (task) contributes to the overall harmony (completion of all tasks). Start by understanding which tasks complement each other. For example, responding to emails while waiting for a meeting to start. Keep in mind that not all tasks harmonize well together, so choose wisely.\n4. “Limit Distractions: The Peaceful Orchestra”\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine trying to conduct a symphony while fireworks go off around you. Not ideal, right? The same goes for multi-tasking. Minimize distractions to maintain focus on your tasks. Close unnecessary tabs, turn off non-urgent notifications, and create a serene environment for your task symphony to play out smoothly.\n5. “Know Your Limits: Juggling vs. Overloading”\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture multi-tasking as juggling. It’s impressive, but too many balls in the air can lead to a circus disaster. Know your limits – juggle a manageable number of tasks. It’s better to have a controlled juggling act than a chaotic mess. Quality over quantity, always.\nConclusion:\nTask management is like orchestrating a beautiful melody – it requires organization, balance, and a bit of finesse. Prioritize tasks like a skilled gardener, using the ABC strategy. When it’s time to juggle, approach multi-tasking like conducting a symphony – harmonize your tasks and limit distractions. Remember, knowing your limits is key. With these simple strategies, you’ll not only manage your tasks effectively but also enjoy the symphony of productivity. Happy task-tackling!"
