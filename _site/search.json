    "text": "3. Data Security and Privacy Considerations\nImportance of Data Security When collecting sensitive information, it’s vital to ensure that the data is secure and that respondents’ privacy is protected.\nTips for Ensuring Data Security\n\nUse Encrypted Data Transmission: SurveyCTO encrypts data, ensuring that it remains secure while being transmitted from devices to the server.\nExample: When an enumerator submits survey responses through their device, the data is encrypted, protecting it from unauthorized access.\nLimit Access to Data: Only allow authorized personnel to access the data collected to reduce the risk of breaches.\nExample: Set user roles in SurveyCTO so that only team leaders and data analysts can view sensitive data, while enumerators have limited access.\nObtain Informed Consent: Always inform respondents about how their data will be used and obtain their consent before collecting personal information.\nExample: During the introduction, the enumerator can explain, “Your responses will help us understand community energy needs. Your answers will remain confidential and will be used for research purposes only.”\n\nConclusion Effective data collection and management are crucial for the success of any research project. By implementing proper training, leveraging technology like GPS and multimedia, and prioritizing data security, you can enhance the quality and reliability of your data. In the upcoming posts, we’ll explore how to analyze CAPI data effectively and discuss common challenges you might encounter. Stay tuned!"

    "text": "Mastering Project Management: A Simple Guide to Success\n\nIntroduction:\nHello, project enthusiasts! Whether you’re a seasoned project manager or someone stepping into the world of coordinating tasks, we’re here to make project management a breeze. In this easy-to-understand guide, we’ll explore how to boost your competence, ensure timely delivery, maintain high-quality output, and foster great communication. Let’s break it down without the jargon and make project success accessible to all!\n1. “Competence: The ABCs of Mastery”\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine project management as a skill playground. Start by learning the basics – understand your project’s objectives, scope, and team dynamics. Familiarize yourself with project management tools; they’re like the cool kids’ toys that make your job easier. As you play in this skill playground, you’ll naturally enhance your competence over time.\n2. “Timely Delivery: The Art of Time Management”\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of project timelines as a recipe – break down the tasks into bite-sized pieces. Create a timeline that’s realistic and achievable. Use a calendar or a project management tool to keep everyone on the same page. Remember, punctuality is the secret ingredient to successful project delivery.\n3. “Quality Output: Crafting a Masterpiece”\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality output is like baking a cake – you need the right ingredients and a foolproof recipe. Clearly define project requirements, encourage collaboration, and perform regular checks to ensure everything is baking – or, in this case, developing – smoothly. The result? A deliciously successful project!\n4. “Great Communication: The Art of Conversation”\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture project communication as a friendly chat. Be clear, concise, and approachable. Share updates regularly and encourage open dialogue. Remember, good communication is a two-way street. Listen as much as you talk, and you’ll find your project sailing smoothly.\n5. “Collaboration: Teamwork Makes the Dream Work”\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of your project team as a well-oiled machine. Encourage collaboration by creating a supportive environment. Clearly define roles, communicate openly, and celebrate achievements together. Remember, everyone plays a crucial part in the success of the project.\n\nConclusion:\nProject management doesn’t have to be a complex puzzle. Break it down into manageable steps, like assembling a Lego set. Start with the basics, manage your time wisely, focus on delivering quality, communicate openly, and foster teamwork. By simplifying project management, you’re not just ensuring success; you’re making the entire process enjoyable for everyone involved. So, grab your toolkit, put on your chef’s hat, and let’s cook up some project success together!"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe health improvements in Morocco over the past two decades are undeniable. Life expectancy has reached its highest point, but the decline in HALE raises questions about how long Moroccans are able to live in good health. As chronic diseases continue to affect the population, policymakers must shift their focus from merely extending life to improving the quality of those extra years.\nBy addressing these health challenges, Morocco can ensure that its aging population enjoys not just longer lives, but healthier ones too. For researchers and public health professionals, HALE provides a valuable metric that complements life expectancy, offering a fuller picture of a nation’s health."

    "text": "A Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Using SPSS\nIn poverty research, the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is a crucial tool for measuring poverty beyond income, capturing deprivations across multiple dimensions such as education and living standards. This blog outlines the exact SPSS code to compute MPI using specific survey indicators.\nLet’s break down the process step by step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the MPI Indicators\nMPI is calculated based on two dimensions—Education and Living Standards—with specific indicators for each. Here’s how you can compute the binary deprivation indicators for each component:\n\nEducation Indicators (Weight: 1/4 for each)\n\nYears of Schooling Completed\nCOMPUTE FIVE_YRS_SCHOOLING_COMPLETED = Q403b &lt; 5.\nSchool-Aged Child Enrollment\nCOMPUTE SCHOOL_AGED_CHILD_NOT_ENROLLED_IN_SCHOOL = Q404 = 1.\n\n\n\nLiving Standards Indicators (Weight: 1/12 for each)\n\nNo Electricity\nCOMPUTE No_electricity = Q409_1 = 0.\nAccess to Clean Drinking Water\nCOMPUTE ACCESS_TO_CLEAN_DRINKING_WATER = Q410 = 6 | Q410 = 7 | Q410 = 8 | Q410 = 10 | Q410 = 11 | Q410 = 12.\nAccess to Improved Sanitation\nCOMPUTE ACCESS_TO_IMPROVED_SANITATION = Q413 = 10 | Q413 = 11 | Q413 = 12 | Q413 = 13.\nDirt Floor\nCOMPUTE DIRT_FLOOR = Q407 = 1 | Q407 = 2.\nDirty Cooking Fuel\nCOMPUTE DIRTY_COOKING_FUEL = Q412 = 7 | Q412 = 8 | Q412 = 9 | Q412 = 10 | Q412 = 11 | Q412 = 12.\nAsset Holding\nCOMPUTE ASSET_HOLDING = (Q409_2 = 0 & Q409_3 = 0 & Q409_4 = 0 & Q409_6 = 0 & Q409_7 = 0 & Q409_8 = 0 & Q409_9 = 0) & (Q409_11 = 0 | Q409_12 = 0).\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Weighting the Indicators\nAfter computing the individual indicators, apply the appropriate weights:\n\nEducation Indicators: Weight = 1/4\nLiving Standard Indicators: Weight = 1/12\n\nExample for the Years of Schooling Completed:\nCOMPUTE FIVE_YRS_SCHOOLING_COMPLETED_weighted = FIVE_YRS_SCHOOLING_COMPLETED * EDUCATION_WGHT.\nSimilarly, compute the weighted versions of all other indicators for education and living standards.\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Deprivation Score\nThe deprivation score is a sum of the weighted indicators, with scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 represents the highest deprivation.\nSyntax:\nCOMPUTE DEPRIVATION_SCORE = FIVE_YRS_SCHOOLING_COMPLETED_weighted + SCHOOL_AGED_CHILD_NOT_ENROLLED_IN_SCHOOL_weighted + No_electricity_WEIGHTED + ACCESS_TO_CLEAN_DRINKING_WATER_weighted + ACCESS_TO_IMPROVED_SANITATION_weighted + DIRT_FLOOR_weighted + DIRTY_COOKING_FUEL_weighted + ASSET_HOLDING_WEIGHTED.\n\n\n\nStep 4: MPI Classification\nFinally, classify households based on their deprivation scores:\n\nNon-Poor: 0-0.19\nVulnerable to Poverty: 0.20-0.33\nMultidimensionally Poor: 0.34-0.50\nSeverely Poor: 0.51+\n\nSyntax:\nRECODE DEPRIVATION_SCORE (0 thru 0.1999=1) (0.2000 thru 0.3333=2) (0.3334 thru 0.5000=3) (0.5001 thru Highest=4) INTO MPI_POVERTY_STATUS2.\n\n\nConclusion\nBy following these steps and using the corresponding SPSS code, you can efficiently compute the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and gain meaningful insights into poverty beyond income-based measures.\nMPI helps identify vulnerable populations, prioritize areas of intervention, and assess the overall well-being of households. If you’re interested in further understanding poverty data and the SPSS process, this guide serves as a comprehensive starting point!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Automating Quality Checks in CAPI Using KoboToolbox Features\nOne of the best features of KoboToolbox is its ability to automate quality checks during data collection. This ensures that the data you collect is clean and ready for analysis, reducing the need for time-consuming manual corrections later.\nHere’s how you can improve data quality with KoboToolbox:\n\nUse Validation Criteria\nKoboToolbox allows you to set validation rules for questions, ensuring that respondents enter data in the correct format. For example, if you’re collecting age data, you can set a rule that the age must be between 0 and 120. This prevents errors like entering “500” as an age.\nExample: If your survey asks, “How many children do you have?” you can set a validation rule to ensure the response is a number between 0 and 15, preventing incorrect entries.\nAdd Mandatory Questions\nYou can make certain questions mandatory so that respondents cannot skip them. This is particularly important for critical questions that are essential to your data analysis.\nExample: In a health survey, you can make the question “What is your gender?” mandatory, ensuring that no response is left out during the interview.\nUse Constraints for Logical Responses\nYou can set constraints to make sure answers are logical. For instance, if someone answers that they are 5 years old, a constraint can prevent them from answering that they have children, as this would be an illogical response.\nExample: If a respondent selects “No” to the question “Do you own a mobile phone?”, you can add a constraint that prevents them from answering follow-up questions about phone usage, improving the survey’s flow.\nPreview and Test Before Data Collection\nAlways preview and test your survey before deployment to ensure that the validation criteria and constraints work as expected. Testing prevents errors during actual data collection.\nExample: Before deploying a survey on school attendance, preview it by entering test responses. This will show you if the logic and constraints work, such as preventing a respondent from entering “10” when asked “How many school days did you miss last month?” if the maximum allowed is 5.\n\n\n\nReal-Time Data Collection and Analysis with KoboToolbox\nOne of the most powerful features of KoboToolbox is the ability to collect and monitor data in real time. This gives you immediate insights into your survey results, enabling you to make adjustments on the fly and ensure data accuracy.\n\nMonitor Data as It’s Collected\nKoboToolbox allows you to view the incoming data while your field team is still collecting it. You can see the number of responses collected, check for any missing or incomplete data, and identify potential issues early on.\nExample: If you’re conducting a survey on household income, you can monitor the data to ensure all responses are complete. If you notice that a certain region is submitting fewer responses, you can contact your field team to address the issue before it becomes a bigger problem.\nExport Data for Analysis\nOnce the data is collected, you can export it to a variety of formats such as Excel, CSV, or even directly into statistical software like R or SPSS for deeper analysis. This allows you to clean and analyze the data as soon as it’s uploaded.\nExample: After completing a survey on water usage in rural areas, you can export the data to Excel, where you can filter responses and run simple analyses, such as calculating the average water consumption per household.\nVisualize Data Quickly\nKoboToolbox includes basic data visualization tools, allowing you to create simple graphs or charts directly on the platform. This is useful for quick insights without having to use other software.\nExample: If you’re collecting data on the types of crops grown in different regions, KoboToolbox lets you generate pie charts to see the proportion of households growing maize, beans, or other crops at a glance.\n\n\n\nHow to Visualize CAPI Data Collected via KoboToolbox\nVisualizing the data collected using KoboToolbox helps turn raw data into meaningful insights. Here’s how you can quickly create visualizations for your data:\n\nUse KoboToolbox’s Built-In Visualization\nKoboToolbox offers simple tools to visualize your survey results as bar charts, pie charts, or frequency tables. This is ideal for getting a quick overview of your data, especially if you need a snapshot during fieldwork.\nExample: After completing a survey on school enrollment, you can quickly create a pie chart to visualize the percentage of boys and girls enrolled in school.\nExport Data for Advanced Visualization\nIf you need more complex visualizations, export the data to Excel or a data visualization tool like Tableau. From there, you can create more detailed graphs, maps, or dashboards to better understand trends or patterns in your data.\nExample: After collecting data on household energy sources, you can export the data to Tableau and create a map that shows which regions rely more on firewood versus electricity, giving you a clearer picture of energy access in different areas.\nVisualize Trends Over Time\nIf your survey involves tracking data over time, you can create trend charts to visualize changes. This is especially useful in longitudinal studies where you need to monitor progress or compare results from different survey rounds.\nExample: If you’re running a survey on child nutrition over several months, you can use KoboToolbox’s export feature to create a line chart in Excel, showing how the average weight of children has changed over time.\n\n\n\nCase Study: Improving Health Data Collection with KoboToolbox CAPI\nTo illustrate the power of KoboToolbox, let’s look at a real-world case study of how it was used to improve health data collection in a rural setting.\nThe Challenge:\nA health NGO was tasked with collecting data on vaccination coverage in remote villages. Previously, they used paper surveys, which often led to errors, delays, and missing data. The team needed a more efficient way to gather accurate information in areas with no internet access.\nThe Solution:\nThe team switched to using KoboToolbox for CAPI. They designed a digital survey with validation rules and skip logic to ensure that only relevant questions were asked. The team collected data offline using the KoboCollect app and synced it later when they returned to areas with internet connectivity.\nResults:\n\nImproved Accuracy: With validation rules, errors were minimized. For example, respondents couldn’t enter invalid ages for children receiving vaccines.\nFaster Data Processing: Instead of waiting weeks for paper forms to be submitted and entered manually, data was available in real time, allowing the team to start analyzing it immediately.\nHigher Quality Data: By using mandatory fields and skip logic, the survey reduced missing responses and improved the overall quality of the data.\n\nExample: In one village, the NGO was able to quickly determine that vaccination coverage for measles was lower than expected, allowing them to take immediate action by organizing more vaccination clinics."

    "title": "DHS Survey Design Computation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When working with Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data, it is crucial to understand certain standardized variables that are consistent across different countries and survey rounds. Three of these essential variables are v005, v021, and v022. These variables play a vital role in ensuring accurate and representative analysis of DHS data.\n\n\n\nThe v005 variable represents the sample weight for each individual in the survey. It is a six-digit number with 6 implied decimal places. Sample weights are used to adjust for the probability of selection, non-response, and other adjustments to ensure that the survey results are representative of the entire population. When analyzing DHS data, it is crucial to use these sample weights to obtain unbiased and accurate estimates.\n\n\n\n\nThe v021 variable indicates the primary sampling unit or cluster number. In DHS surveys, households are often grouped into clusters known as PSUs. This variable helps in accounting for the survey's complex design by identifying these clusters. Properly accounting for PSUs is essential for accurate variance estimation and analysis.\n\n\n\n\nThe v022 variable represents the sample stratum number. Stratification is a technique used in survey sampling to divide the population into different subgroups, or strata, based on certain characteristics. In DHS surveys, strata are often formed by geographic regions and urban/rural areas. This variable is important for specifying the stratification in the survey design, which is critical for proper weighting and variance estimation.\n\n\n\nTo effectively analyze DHS data, it is important to account for these variables in your statistical analysis. Here is an example of how to use these variables in R to set up\n# Install and load the survey package\ninstall.packages(\"survey\")\nlibrary(survey)\n\n# Assuming your DHS data is in a data frame called df\n# Create a survey design object\ndhs_design &lt;- svydesign(\n  id = ~v021,        # Primary Sampling Unit (PSU)\n  strata = ~v022,    # Strata\n  weights = ~v005,   # Sample weights\n  data = df,\n  nest = TRUE\n)\n\n# Now you can use the dhs_design object to perform weighted analyses\n\nThis setup allows you to correctly analyze the DHS data, taking into account the complex survey design, including clustering, stratification, and sampling weights.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the roles of v005, v021, and v022 in DHS data is essential for accurate and representative analysis. By properly incorporating these variables into your analysis, you can ensure that your findings are both valid and reliable. Whether you are a seasoned researcher or new to DHS data, mastering these key variables will significantly enhance the quality of your analysis."

Three of these essential variables are v005, v021, and v022. These variables play a vital role in ensuring accurate and representative analysis of DHS data.\n\n\n\nThe v005 variable represents the sample weight for each individual in the survey. It is a six-digit number with 6 implied decimal places. Sample weights are used to adjust for the probability of selection, non-response, and other adjustments to ensure that the survey results are representative of the entire population. When analyzing DHS data, it is crucial to use these sample weights to obtain unbiased and accurate estimates.\n\n\n\n\nThe v021 variable indicates the primary sampling unit or cluster number. In DHS surveys, households are often grouped into clusters known as PSUs. This variable helps in accounting for the survey's complex design by identifying these clusters. Properly accounting for PSUs is essential for accurate variance estimation and analysis.\n\n\n\n\nThe v022 variable represents the sample stratum number. Stratification is a technique used in survey sampling to divide the population into different subgroups, or strata, based on certain characteristics. In DHS surveys, strata are often formed by geographic regions and urban/rural areas. This variable is important for specifying the stratification in the survey design, which is critical for proper weighting and variance estimation.\n\n\n\nTo effectively analyze DHS data, it is important to account for these variables in your statistical analysis. Here is an example of how to use these variables in R to set up\n# Install and load the survey package\ninstall.packages(\"survey\")\nlibrary(survey)\n\n# Assuming your DHS data is in a data frame called df\n# Create a survey design object\ndhs_design &lt;- svydesign(\n  id = ~v021,        # Primary Sampling Unit (PSU)\n  strata = ~v022,    # Strata\n  weights = ~v005,   # Sample weights\n  data = df,\n  nest = TRUE\n)\n\n# Now you can use the dhs_design object to perform weighted analyses\n\nThis setup allows you to correctly analyze the DHS data, taking into account the complex survey design, including clustering, stratification, and sampling weights.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the roles of v005, v021, and v022 in DHS data is essential for accurate and representative analysis. By properly incorporating these variables into your analysis, you can ensure that your findings are both valid and reliable. Whether you are a seasoned researcher or new to DHS data, mastering these key variables will significantly enhance the quality of your analysis."

    "title": "Getting Weather Data via API with R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I came across this awesome post from Albert Rapp about how to get weather data from API and I thought it was a great technique to use. Here we go.\n\nWhat is an API?\nWe are focusing on two APIs (application programming interfaces) for our project. Broadly speaking, an API is anything that we can throw code at to get results that we want.\nOften this refers to some data source that we tap into. But sometimes it also simply means the syntax of code. For example, ggplot2 has a very distinctive API, i.e. a code syntax to create a chart.\nIn our current case, we will just refer to APIs as data sources and we will need to tap into two such APIs, namely these ones:\n\nUS National Weather Service API\nGoogle Geocoding API\n\nThe first one will give us weather forecasts based on specified coordinates and the second one will turn any address into coordinates for us. Today, we’ll focus on the first one.\n\n\nMaking requests to an API\nIf you’ve never worked with APIs, you know that it can feel like data is hidden away behind an API. Thankfully, the {httr2} package helps us a lot, even if we’ve never dealt with APIs before.\nCase in point, my fellow YouTubeR (see what I did there? it’s “YouTube” and “R”) Melissa Van Bussel put together an excellent video that shows you how to use {httr2} to call the API of openAI or GitLab.\nAnyway, here’s how to make a request to an API to get data:\n\nNavigate to the URL the data can be accessed from\n(Optional depending on the API) Authenticate\nGet the response\n\nWith the National Weather Service, you can easily try this yourself. Just head to the following url using your web browser:\nhttps://api.weather.gov/points/38.8894,-77.0352\nIf you navigate there, you will get cryptic data like that:\n\nThis is what is known as a JSON file. More on that later. For now, notice that what you see at the end of the url after points/ corresponds to the coordinates that are given in the JSON output.\nThis means that the recipe for calling the weather API is simple: Append points/{lat},{long} at the end of the base_url, i.e. https://api.weather.gov/. In this case, {lat},{long} corresponds to the latitude and longitude of the location you want to get weather forecasts for.\n\n\nMaking a request with {httr2}\nThe {httr2} syntax to make this work mimics this quite well. Here’s how it looks.\n\nBasically, at the core of every request is the request() function that needs to know the base_url. This returns an &lt;httr2_request&gt; object that can be passed to further req_*() functions to modify the request.\nHere, we used req_url_path_append() to modify the request but there are also other functions (and next week we’ll learn about req_url_query()). Finally, to actually make the request, you can pass everything to req_perform().\n\n\n\nGetting the response\nAs you’ve just seen, your request will return a &lt;httr2_response&gt; and if everything went well, the output will also show you Status: 200 OK. You can get the actual content (the JSON that you’ve seen in your web browser earlier) via one of the many resp_*() functions that handle responses.\n\n\n\nWorking with the response\nAs you’ve seen in the output, the JSON file you receive is structured as a highly nested list. To make sense of this data, we use glimpse() to understand the structure of the object\n\nAnd with pluck() you can easily drill down into specific parts of the list. For example, this could be used to get the URL for the hourly forecasts\n\n\n\nRepeat process for forecasts\nWith the new forecast URL, we can get new JSON data about the forecasts for our location.\n\nIn that output, we can see that there is a list called periods inside of the properties list that contains lists which always have 16 entries. This might be where our forecast data lives.\n\nAha! Each of those 16-entries lists seem to correspond to the forecast of one hour. Thus, to get the things like temperature, startTime, probabilityOfPrecipitation, and short_forecast into a nice tibble format, we have to iterate over all of these 16-entries lists and wrap the values we want into a tibble.\n\nAnd once we have that data, we can transform the time column into a nice date-time object:\n\nThis was awesome. !"

    "section": "Interpretation of the Data",
    "text": "Interpretation of the Data\n\nFrom the table and the visualization, it is evident that counties such as West Pokot, Mandera, and Homa Bay have significantly improved their absorption rates, with each showing substantial increases from 2021 to 2022. Mandera, in particular, saw a remarkable 5.9% increase in its absorption rate from 2021. On the other hand, counties like Kiambu and Kisii experienced noticeable declines, highlighting inefficiencies in fund utilization. For example, Kiambu’s rate dropped from 73.2% in 2021 to 67.2% in 2022, which could indicate governance issues or inadequate monitoring of healthcare projects.\nImplications for Government, Donors, and Investors\nFor the Kenyan government, improving absorption rates should be a priority, as efficient use of funds directly impacts the delivery of healthcare services to the public. Lower absorption rates, especially in resource-rich counties like Kiambu, could result in missed opportunities for improving public health infrastructure. Donors and investors must consider the absorption rate when allocating funds to ensure that their contributions are being utilized effectively."

    "text": "Analysis\n\nRepetition within grades in Primary Education\nThis analysis shows the findings of how repetition in grades in primary school varies across grades in school. It can be seen that at the time of study, apart from primary 1 having the highest number of students, 39.5 percent of the 686 pupils in that class had actually repeated the same grade from 2012. The other classes with the highest repetition rate are primary 2 (23.6 percent of 470), primary 5 (22.3 percent of 260), primary 3 (16.8 percent of 392) and primary 4 (16.7 percent of 305). It is also worthy noting that from post primary 1 to post primary 5 there was no cases of repetiton from 2012.\nThe R code of producing this is\n## how grade repetition varies by grade in Primary Education \ncomparis &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(!(Grade_2012%in%c(\"Not in class\")))\ntable(comparis$Grade_2012,comparis$repeated)-&gt;comparison_repetition_in_classes_2012\nprop.table(comparison_repetition_in_classes_2012,1)*100-&gt;tabwew\ntabwew %&gt;% knitr::kable()\n\nggplot(comparis, aes(x=repeated))+ geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")+facet_wrap(~Grade_2012)\nggplot(comparis, aes(x=Grade_2012,fill =repeated))+ geom_bar(position = \"stack\")+coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost primary 1\n\n100.00000\n\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost primary 3\n\n100.00000\n\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost primary 4\n\n100.00000\n\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost primary 5\n\n100.00000\n\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-primary\n\n95.88235\n\n4.117647\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary 1\n\n60.49563\n\n39.504373\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary 2\n\n76.38298\n\n23.617021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary 3\n\n83.16327\n\n16.836735\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary 4\n\n83.27869\n\n16.721311\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary 5\n\n77.69231\n\n22.307692\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary 6,7,8\n\n93.19728\n\n6.802721\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary 1\n\n97.67442\n\n2.325581\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary 2\n\n90.56604\n\n9.433962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary 3\n\n94.11765\n\n5.882353\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary 4\n\n100.00000\n\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary 5\n\n100.00000\n\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondary 6\n\n100.00000\n\n0.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMales equally likely to drop out as females.\nThe research also wanted to check which gender had a higher drop out rate. The results showed a comparisons which was not significate between the two genders (since t.test for which variance is same showes a p-value of 0.9765 using Welch two sample test, which is &gt; 0.05). This shows that the two means of the genders were almost equal and therefore the conclusion would be that both male and female pupils had equal chances of dropping out from school.\n\n\nRegression analysis\nIn with the aim of investigating the determinants contributing to increase in rate of repetition, the researcher opted to consider the following predictor variables;- the weight, age, whether the father or mother was alive or not, the health problems suffered in the last 4 weeks, grade attended in during 2012 and 2013, who paid for the student expenses for the last 12 months and the reason why they(pupils who missed) didnt attend school. The response variable would be repeating a grade in school which would be binary,where 1 would mean repeated is true and 0 if otherwise. A binary logistic regression model was used. The predictor with p-value that were less than 0.05 were reported as significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregion_class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestimate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstd.error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np.adjusted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRural\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2012Primary

table above show the findings of analysis from the rural area in rwanda where only problems experienced in school, grade in 2012 and 2013 were significant, we took . It shows that in 2012, pupils in primary 5,(6 to 8),4,3,2 and 1 were 13.73, 10.91, 9.12, 6.11, 3.74, 2.09 times more likely to repeat the same grade, in that order, than the students in post primary 1. Other hand, in 2013, pupils in pre-primary were 27 percent less likely to repeat the same grade as compared to those in post primary 1 in 2013. Further, those in primary 6, 7, 8 in 2013, were the least likely to repeat, i.e, 96.7 percent less likely to repeat as compared to post primary 1 in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregion_class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestimate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstd.error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np.adjusted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2012Primary 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.531815\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.3913698\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2012Primary 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.737260\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.3011179\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000270\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2012Primary 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.507446\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.2891581\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0002122\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2012Primary 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.188648\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.2228084\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0001380\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2012Primary 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.803433\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1679609\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0009979\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2013Secondary 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1.497037\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4055512\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0004833\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0401101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2013Secondary 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1.829716\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4934564\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0004582\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0384918\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2013Primary 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1.922012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.3655888\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0001822\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2013Primary 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2.367172\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.3945070\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000115\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2013Primary 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2.724553\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4261606\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2013Primary 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2.922021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4293049\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade_2013Primary 6,7,8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-3.963184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5191857\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above as shows a snap short of the analysis of urban areas in Rwanda.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Designing Effective Surveys for CAPI with KoboToolbox\nCreating well-structured surveys is key to collecting accurate and useful data. With KoboToolbox, you can design surveys that are easy for both respondents and interviewers to understand. Here’s how to ensure your surveys are clear, efficient, and effective:\n\nUse Simple, Clear Language\nWhen designing your survey, make sure the questions are easy to understand. Avoid technical jargon or complex wording. The simpler your questions, the more accurate your data will be.\nExample: Instead of asking, “What is your frequency of maize consumption in a bi-weekly period?”, you can ask, “How often do you eat maize in two weeks?” This reduces confusion and ensures respondents provide the correct answers.\nChoose the Right Question Types\nKoboToolbox offers a variety of question types, such as multiple-choice, single-choice, and text answers. Choose the type that best fits the information you need:\n\nSingle-choice for questions with one possible answer (e.g., “What is your gender?”).\nMultiple-choice for questions where more than one answer is possible (e.g., “Which of the following crops do you grow?”).\nText input for open-ended questions (e.g., “Please describe the challenges you face in farming.”).\n\nExample: When conducting a household survey, you might ask:\n\n“What is your source of drinking water?” (Single choice: river, well, tap water)\n“What sanitation facilities do you use?” (Multiple choice: pit latrine, flush toilet, none)\n\nUse Skip Logic for Relevant Questions\nSkip logic helps guide respondents to relevant questions based on their previous answers. This saves time and ensures respondents only answer questions that apply to them.\nExample: If you ask, “Do you own a mobile phone?” and the respondent answers “No,” skip the following questions about phone usage and move directly to the next relevant section.\nTest Your Survey Before Deployment\nBefore deploying your survey to the field, always test it. KoboToolbox lets you preview the survey, so you can see how the questions flow and identify any issues with wording, skip logic, or design.\nExample: You can test a health survey by filling out the questions yourself or with colleagues to ensure everything functions smoothly. This way, you catch any problems early, like a question not appearing at the right time.\n\n\n\nBest Practices for Managing CAPI Teams Using KoboToolbox\nWhen you’re working with a field team to collect data using KoboToolbox, it’s essential to ensure that everyone is organized and on the same page. Effective management leads to smoother data collection and higher quality results.\n\nTrain Your Team on KoboToolbox\nBefore your team heads into the field, make sure everyone understands how to use KoboCollect (the mobile app) and the survey itself. Provide hands-on training, including how to download and sync surveys, enter responses, and handle common issues.\nExample: If you’re conducting a baseline survey in a rural community, walk your team through using the app offline. This way, when they are in areas with no internet, they’ll know how to collect data without problems and upload it when they return to base.\nAssign Clear Roles and Responsibilities\nDivide tasks among your team members to avoid confusion. Have specific people responsible for technical support, others for managing data quality, and the rest for conducting interviews.\nExample: If you have a team of 10, designate one or two people as “data quality checkers” who review incoming data each day, while the remaining team members focus on conducting interviews and syncing responses.\nSet Realistic Daily Targets\nEnsure your team has a clear goal for the number of interviews they should complete each day. This helps keep everyone motivated and ensures you collect enough data on time.\nExample: If your project requires 500 responses in 5 days, divide this among the team so each member knows their target. For a team of 10, this means completing 10 interviews per person per day.\nMonitor Data Quality in Real-Time\nOne of the advantages of KoboToolbox is that it allows you to monitor data as it’s being collected. Regularly check incoming data for consistency and completeness. If there are any errors, you can address them before the team finishes the fieldwork.\nExample: If you notice that certain responses are missing or inconsistent (e.g., many participants skipping a particular question), you can inform your team immediately to clarify the questions during interviews.\n\n\n\nOffline CAPI Data Collection: Overcoming Connectivity Challenges with KoboToolbox\nCollecting data in areas with poor or no internet connection can be challenging. Fortunately, KoboToolbox is built for these environments. Here’s how to make the most of its offline capabilities:\n\nDownload Surveys in Advance\nBefore heading into the field, ensure that your team has downloaded the survey to their mobile devices. KoboCollect stores the surveys locally, so they can be accessed without an internet connection.\nExample: If you’re working in remote villages in Kenya, your team can download the surveys while they still have internet access at the office or in town. Once they reach the field, they can continue interviewing participants without needing Wi-Fi or mobile data.\nCollect Data Offline and Sync Later\nDuring interviews, KoboCollect will save all the responses on the device. When your team returns to an area with internet, they can upload all the data to the KoboToolbox server with one click.\nExample: After a long day of interviewing farmers about their crop yields, your team gets back to the office where there’s Wi-Fi. They sync their devices, and all the data is uploaded to the server without any issues.\nPlan for Backup Power\nIn remote areas, battery life is a big concern. Ensure your team has portable chargers or backup power sources to keep their devices running throughout the day.\nExample: If your team is surveying in a rural area where electricity is unreliable, equip them with power banks to keep their devices charged. This way, they can keep collecting data without interruption."

    "section": "2. Causal Inference and Counterfactuals",
    "text": "2. Causal Inference and Counterfactuals\nCausal inference is the process of determining whether a program or intervention (like the School Feeding Program) directly causes a change in an outcome, such as improved school attendance. It goes beyond simple associations to uncover cause-and-effect relationships by comparing what happened with what could have happened if the program had not been implemented.\nThe idea of counterfactuals lies at the heart of causal inference. A counterfactual refers to the hypothetical scenario of what would have occurred in the absence of the program. Since we cannot observe both the actual outcome and the counterfactual for the same household, researchers rely on rigorous study designs (such as randomized control trials) or statistical techniques to estimate the counterfactual and isolate the program’s impact.\n\nBefore-After Designs\nThe first “expert” consultant you hire suggests that to estimate the impact of the School Feeding Program (SFP), you should calculate the change in student attendance rates over time for the schools where households enrolled in the program. The consultant argues that because SFP provides meals that alleviate hunger and improve student focus, any increase in attendance rates over time can be attributed to the program’s effect.\nUsing the subset of schools in treatment localities, you calculate their average student attendance rates before the implementation of the program and then again two years later. The analysis focuses on comparing the average attendance rates at baseline and follow-up to assess the program’s impact in villages participating in the School Feeding Program.\n\nm_ba1 &lt;- lm_robust(attendance_rate ~ round, \n                   clusters = locality_identifier,\n                   data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(treatment_locality==1 & enrolled ==1))\n\n\nm_ba2 &lt;- lm_robust(attendance_rate ~ round + age_hh + age_sp + educ_hh + \n                     educ_sp + female_hh + indigenous + hhsize + dirtfloor + \n                     bathroom + land + school_distance, \n                   clusters = locality_identifier,\n                   data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(treatment_locality==1 & enrolled ==1))\n\nt0 &lt;- tbl_regression(m_ba1, intercept = T)\nt01 &lt;- tbl_regression(m_ba2, intercept = T)\n\ntbl_merge_m_ba &lt;-\n  tbl_merge(\n    tbls = list(t0, t01),\n    tab_spanner = c(\"No Controls\", \"With Controls\")\n  )\n\ntbl_merge_m_ba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n\nNo Controls\n\n\nWith Controls\n\n\n\nBeta\n95% CI1\np-value\nBeta\n95% CI1\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n88\n87, 88\n&lt;0.001\n79\n78, 80\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nround\n5.7\n5.3, 6.1\n&lt;0.001\n5.7\n5.3, 6.1\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nage_hh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.05\n-0.07, -0.03\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nage_sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.00\n-0.03, 0.02\n&gt;0.9\n\n\neduc_hh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.05\n-0.11, 0.01\n0.079\n\n\neduc_sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.07\n0.00, 0.13\n0.038\n\n\nfemale_hh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.86\n-1.4, -0.28\n0.004\n\n\nindigenous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7\n1.3, 2.1\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nhhsize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n1.5, 1.6\n&lt;0.001\n\n\ndirtfloor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0\n1.7, 2.3\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nbathroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.31\n-0.60, -0.02\n0.039\n\n\nland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.08\n-0.13, -0.04\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nschool_distance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.00\n0.00, 0.01\n0.14\n\n\n\n1 CI = Confidence Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the before-and-after comparison control for all the factors that affect student attendance over time?\nNo, it is unlikely that this analysis accounts for all the factors influencing attendance. For instance, there could be other educational or health-related interventions occurring simultaneously in the communities receiving the School Feeding Program (SFP), which might also contribute to changes in attendance. Additionally, external factors like a regional economic crisis or natural disasters could have independently affected attendance. In the absence of SFP, attendance might have increased or decreased due to these factors, making it challenging to attribute all observed changes solely to the program.\nBased on these results produced by the before-and-after analysis, should SFP be scaled up nationally?\nNo, based on the current results, scaling up the program nationally might not be justified yet. While the School Feeding Program appears to have improved average attendance rates, the increase of 5.7 percentage points may not be sufficient to meet the government’s threshold for program effectiveness. Moreover, without understanding the contribution of confounding factors, it remains unclear whether the observed improvements are entirely due to the program.\n\n\nEnrolled vs. Non-Enrolled\nAnother consultant proposes a different approach, suggesting it would be more appropriate to estimate the counterfactual in the post-intervention period, two years after the program’s start. The consultant correctly notes that of the 5,929 households in the baseline sample, only 2,907 enrolled in the School Feeding Program (SFP), leaving approximately 51 percent of households without access to SFP.\nThe consultant argues that all schools within the 100 pilot villages were eligible to enroll in the program, with households in these communities sharing similar characteristics. For example, households rely on comparable school infrastructures, face similar regional conditions, and have children subject to the same school policies. Furthermore, economic activities and living standards within these localities are generally uniform.\nThe consultant asserts that under such circumstances, attendance rates for households not enrolled in SFP after the intervention can reasonably estimate the counterfactual outcomes for those enrolled. Consequently, you decide to compare average student attendance rates in the post-intervention period for both groups—schools participating in the School Feeding Program and those that opted out.\n\nm_ene1 &lt;- lm_robust(attendance_rate ~ enrolled, \n                    clusters = locality_identifier,\n                    data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(treatment_locality==1 & round ==1))\n\nm_ene2 &lt;- lm_robust(attendance_rate ~ enrolled + age_hh + age_sp + educ_hh + \n                      educ_sp + female_hh + indigenous + hhsize + dirtfloor + \n                      bathroom + land + school_distance, \n                    clusters = locality_identifier,\n                    data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(treatment_locality==1 & round ==1))\n\nt0a &lt;- tbl_regression(m_ene1, intercept = T)\nt0a1 &lt;- tbl_regression(m_ene2, intercept = T)\n\ntbl_merge_m_ene &lt;-\n  tbl_merge(\n    tbls = list(t0a, t0a1),\n    tab_spanner = c(\"No Controls\", \"With Controls\")\n  )\n\ntbl_merge_m_ene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n\nNo Controls\n\n\nWith Controls\n\n\n\nBeta\n95% CI1\np-value\nBeta\n95% CI1\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n81\n80, 81\n&lt;0.001\n74\n72, 76\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nenrolled\n12\n12, 13\n&lt;0.001\n8.5\n8.0, 9.1\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nage_hh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.08\n-0.12, -0.04\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nage_sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.04\n0.00, 0.09\n0.045\n\n\neduc_hh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.04\n-0.06, 0.14\n0.5\n\n\neduc_sp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.10\n-0.02, 0.22\n0.088\n\n\nfemale_hh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.50\n-1.6, 0.58\n0.4\n\n\nindigenous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7\n0.84, 2.5\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nhhsize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7\n1.6, 1.8\n&lt;0.001\n\n\ndirtfloor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7\n1.2, 2.3\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nbathroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.53\n-1.1, 0.00\n0.052\n\n\nland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.01\n-0.09, 0.11\n0.8\n\n\nschool_distance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.01\n-0.01, 0.02\n0.3\n\n\n\n1 CI = Confidence Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this analysis likely control for all the factors that determine differences in student attendance between the enrolled and non-enrolled groups?\nNo, it is unlikely that the multivariate analysis fully controls for all the factors that influence the difference in attendance rates between the two groups. There could be unobservable factors that contribute to why some schools enroll in the feeding program while others do not. For instance, household preferences, school engagement levels, or the motivation of parents could play a role in determining which schools opt for the program. These factors may not be fully captured in the analysis.\nBased on these results produced by the enrolled vs. non-enrolled method, should the School Feeding Program (SFP) be scaled up nationally?\nBased strictly on the estimate from the multivariate linear regression, the SFP should not be scaled up nationally based on the findings here. The program increased average student attendance by 8.5%, which is a positive but modest improvement. While this result is statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.001), it is lower than the expected national threshold improvement in attendance, suggesting that scaling up the program may not immediately achieve the desired outcomes at a larger scale. However, the modest effect size means that further investigation into the program’s impact across different contexts and regions is necessary to determine if it could contribute meaningfully to national efforts in improving student attendance."

    "section": "3. Randomized Assignment",
    "text": "3. Randomized Assignment\nRandom Assignment in the context of our school feeding program evaluation means that households or communities are randomly assigned to either the treatment group (where they receive the feeding program) or the control group (where they do not). This random assignment ensures that every participant has an equal chance of being placed in either group, making it more likely that the groups are similar at the start of the study. As a result, any differences in outcomes, such as changes in children’s health or learning outcomes, can be attributed to the school feeding program itself, rather than other external factors. This method strengthens the validity of our findings and helps ensure that the observed impacts are genuinely due to the program intervention.\nThe key is to find a group of villages that are very similar to the 100 treatment villages, except for the fact that one group participated in the school feeding program and the other did not. Since the treatment villages were randomly selected from the pool of rural villages, they should, on average, have similar characteristics to those villages that did not participate in the program.\nTo improve the counterfactual estimate, we utilize an additional 100 rural villages that were not part of the feeding program. These comparison villages were also randomly selected, ensuring that they share similar characteristics with the treatment villages at the outset of the program. The random assignment of the program ensures that any differences in outcomes (e.g., improvements in children’s nutrition or learning) between the treatment and comparison villages can be attributed to the program, not external factors.\nTo validate this assumption, we would need to test whether the characteristics of eligible households in both the treatment and comparison villages were similar at the baseline, ensuring that no major differences existed before the program began. If the characteristics are similar, it further supports the idea that the program’s effects are due to the intervention itself rather than other external factors.\n\ndf_elig &lt;- trans_df %&gt;%\n  filter(eligible == 1) \n\ndf_elig %&gt;% \n  filter(round == 0) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(treatment_locality, locality_identifier,\n                age_hh, age_sp, educ_hh, educ_sp, female_hh, indigenous, \n                hhsize, dirtfloor, bathroom, land, school_distance) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(-c(\"treatment_locality\",\"locality_identifier\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(name) %&gt;%\n  do(tidy(lm_robust(value ~ treatment_locality, data = .))) %&gt;%\n  filter(term == \"treatment_locality\") %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(name, estimate, std.error, p.value) %&gt;%\n  kable()\n\n\n\n\nname\nestimate\nstd.error\np.value\n\n\n\n\nage_hh\n-0.6354625\n0.3759583\n0.0910361\n\n\nage_sp\n-0.0386302\n0.3120790\n0.9014911\n\n\nbathroom\n0.0149907\n0.0132340\n0.2573724\n\n\ndirtfloor\n-0.0129497\n0.0118744\n0.2755159\n\n\neduc_hh\n0.1607976\n0.0697576\n0.0211978\n\n\neduc_sp\n0.0289107\n0.0670018\n0.6661273\n\n\nfemale_hh\n-0.0041155\n0.0070493\n0.5593691\n\n\nhhsize\n0.0596953\n0.0530454\n0.2604833\n\n\nindigenous\n0.0091048\n0.0131969\n0.4902756\n\n\nland\n-0.0402168\n0.0704607\n0.5681787\n\n\nschool_distance\n2.9087631\n1.1323148\n0.0102288\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average characteristics of households in both the treatment and comparison villages appear very similar. Among the various variables tested, the only statistically significant differences are in the number of years of education of the head of household and the distance to the nearest school, which are relatively small in magnitude. Specifically, the difference in the education of the household head is 0.16 years (which is less than 6% of the average years of education in the comparison group), and the difference in the distance to school is 2.91 kilometers (less than 3% of the comparison group’s average distance). These differences are statistically significant, but small, indicating that the two groups are quite similar in terms of key demographic factors.\nEven in a randomized experiment involving a large sample, small differences can occur by chance due to the nature of statistical tests. In fact, using a typical 5% significance level, we would expect some differences in around 5% of the characteristics simply due to random variability. Therefore, although small statistically significant differences exist, the overall similarity between the two groups suggests that the random assignment was effective and that the treatment and comparison groups are comparable for the evaluation of the feeding program’s impact.\nEstimate the average attendance rate for eligible households in the treatment and comparison villages for each period.

This confirms that the groups are similar, as expected under randomized assignment. The baseline results show that the treatment locality (the area receiving the feeding program) does not significantly differ from the comparison group in terms of the outcome measure (Beta = 0.07, p-value = 0.7).\nAt follow-up, however, the treatment locality shows a statistically significant and positive effect on the outcome measure, with a beta coefficient of 8.7 (p-value &lt; 0.001). This indicates that households in the treatment locality saw a notable improvement compared to those in the comparison villages. Specifically, the intervention appears to have resulted in an increase in the outcome, possibly reflecting the positive effects of the feeding program, given the substantial change in the beta coefficient.\nThe impact of the program is therefore evident in the follow-up period, and the reduction in the treatment and comparison villages’ differences shows a clear program effect, with an estimated increase of 8.7 units on the attendance rate, which is statistically significant.\nThus, these findings support the conclusion that the feeding program had a positive impact on the target population over the course of the study period.\nRe-estimate using a multivariate regression analysis that controls for the other observable characteristics of the sample households.

This suggests that, without adjusting for other factors, the households in the treatment locality (those receiving the feeding program) exhibit a significant improvement compared to those in the comparison group.\nWith Covariate Adjustment:\nWhen adjusting for other observable characteristics such as age, education, and household size, the coefficient for the treatment locality is slightly reduced to 8.6 (95% CI: 8.0 to 9.2) but remains statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.001). This indicates that even when accounting for factors like age, education, and household characteristics, the treatment locality still shows a strong and positive effect, with the intervention leading to a substantial improvement in the outcome measure.\n\nWhy is the Impact Estimate Unchanged with Covariate Adjustment?\nThe treatment effect remains nearly unchanged when controlling for additional factors because of the randomized assignment. Randomization ensures that the treatment and comparison groups are very similar in characteristics at baseline, and external factors affecting the outcome should affect both groups equally over time. Therefore, any changes observed in the treatment locality compared to the comparison group can confidently be attributed to the feeding program rather than differences in baseline characteristics or external influences.\n\n\nConclusion on the Program’s Impact\nGiven that the estimated impact remains consistent even after controlling for additional characteristics, it is clear that the feeding program has a significant positive effect on the target population. The treatment group shows a noticeable improvement in outcomes, and this improvement is robust to covariate adjustments.\n\n\nShould the Feeding Program Be Scaled Up?\nYes, the feeding program should be scaled up. The impact on the outcome measure is statistically significant and substantial. The effect of the intervention, even after accounting for other factors, supports the case for expanding the program to other regions to improve the well-being of households in similar circumstances."

    "text": "4. Instrumental Variables\nInstrumental Variables in the context of our school feeding program help us figure out how the program affects attendance rates when other factors might confuse the results. An instrumental variable is something that influences whether a child participates in the program (like whether their school is in a treatment area) but doesn’t directly impact attendance rates except through the program itself. This approach helps isolate the program’s true effect on attendance, even if there are other overlapping influences.\nLet us now try using the randomized promotion method to evaluate the impact of the school feeding program (SFP) on attendance rates. Imagine the Ministry of Education decides that the feeding program should eventually be made available to all schools nationwide. This is a different situation from the randomized assignment design we’ve considered so far. However, given the logistical realities of scaling the program, you propose an incremental rollout.\nTo assess its impact, you randomly select a subset of schools (indicated by promotion_locality) to receive an intensive promotion campaign aimed at increasing awareness and participation in the feeding program. This campaign includes activities such as community outreach, parent meetings, and tailored communication materials to emphasize the program’s benefits. Importantly, the promotion focuses solely on raising awareness and boosting program enrollment, ensuring it does not directly encourage unrelated behaviors that could influence attendance rates. This design ensures the promotion can be used as a valid instrumental variable (IV) for understanding how the feeding program affects attendance rates.\nWhat was the effect of the promotion campaign upon enrollment?\nNote you should use the variable enrolled_rp for this question\n\nm_enroll &lt;- lm_robust(enrolled_rp ~ promotion_locality,\n                      clusters = locality_identifier,\n                      data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(round == 1))\n\nt_enroll &lt;- tbl_regression(m_enroll, intercept = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  add_glance_source_note(\n    glance_fun = broom::glance, # Extract model summary\n    include = c(\"adj.r.squared\", \"r.squared\", \"nobs\") # Add Adjusted R-squared\n  )\n\nt_enroll\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    (Intercept)\n0.08\n0.04, 0.13\n0.001\n    promotion_locality\n0.41\n0.34, 0.48\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n    \n      Adjusted R² = 0.200; R² = 0.200; No. Obs. = 9,914\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAfter two years of promotion and program implementation, you find that 41% of students in schools randomly assigned to the promotion campaign are attending school more regularly, compared to only 8% in non-promoted schools.\nBecause the promoted and non-promoted schools were assigned at random, we can confidently assume that the baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar in the absence of the promotion. This assumption is validated by comparing baseline attendance rates and other school-related characteristics, which showed no significant differences.\nFrom the results in Table 2, the estimated impact of the promotion locality on attendance rates is a significant increase of 41 percentage points (Beta = 0.41, 95% CI [0.34, 0.48], p &lt; 0.001). The intercept (baseline attendance rate in non-promoted schools) was estimated at 8% (Beta = 0.08, 95% CI [0.04, 0.13], p = 0.001). The model explains 20% of the variation in attendance rates (Adjusted R² = 0.20), indicating a strong relationship between promotion and improved attendance outcomes.\nCompare baseline attendance rates based upon assignment to promotion.\n\nm_base_attend &lt;- lm_robust(attendance_rate ~ promotion_locality,\n                           clusters = locality_identifier,\n                           data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(round == 0)\n)\n\nt_base_attend &lt;- tbl_regression(m_base_attend, intercept = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  add_glance_source_note(\n    glance_fun = broom::glance, # Extract model summary\n    include = c(\"adj.r.squared\", \"r.squared\", \"nobs\") # Add Adjusted R-squared\n  ) \nt_base_attend\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    (Intercept)\n85\n85, 86\n&lt;0.001\n    promotion_locality\n0.05\n-0.44, 0.53\n0.9\n  \n  \n    \n      Adjusted R² = 0.000; R² = 0.000; No. Obs. = 9,913\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nEstimate the difference in attendance rates by assignment to promotion, in the post-treatment period\n\nm_post_attend &lt;- lm_robust(attendance_rate ~ promotion_locality,\n                           clusters = locality_identifier,\n                           data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(round == 1)\n)\n\nt_post_attend &lt;- tbl_regression(m_post_attend, intercept = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  add_glance_source_note(\n    glance_fun = broom::glance, # Extract model summary\n    include = c(\"adj.r.squared\", \"r.squared\", \"nobs\") # Add Adjusted R-squared\n  ) \nt_post_attend\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    (Intercept)\n84\n83, 85\n&lt;0.001\n    promotion_locality\n3.3\n2.2, 4.4\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n    \n      Adjusted R² = 0.026; R² = 0.027; No. Obs. = 9,914\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nUsing this attendance rate estimate and the estimated proportion of “compliers”, estimate the LATE/CACE\n\nLATE (Local Average Treatment Effect):\nLATE measures the effect of the program only on the group that complied with the treatment assignment (e.g., those who were offered the feeding program and actually participated).

The p-value is greater than the 0.05 significance level, which means that any differences in baseline attendance are likely due to random variation, not the promotion itself.\nEstimate the difference in attendance rates by assignment to promotion, in the post-treatment period\nThe post attendance period shows a significant positive effect on attendance, with a coefficient of 3.3 (95% CI [2.2, 4.4], p-value &lt; 0.001). This suggests that schools assigned to the feeding program promotion saw an increase in attendance rates by about 3.3 percentage points compared to non-promoted schools. The model’s adjusted R² of 0.026 indicates that a small proportion of the variation in attendance is explained by the promotion, but the effect is still statistically significant.\nUsing this attendance rate estimate and the estimated proportion of “compliers,” estimate the LATE/CACE\nThe Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) and the Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) are estimated by considering both unadjusted and adjusted models.\nNo Covariate Adjustment: The coefficient for the promotion locality remains significant (Beta = 8.1, 95% CI [6.2, 10], p-value &lt; 0.001), suggesting that, on average, the promotion led to an 8.1 percentage point increase in attendance for those schools in the promotion locality who complied with the program.\nWith Covariate Adjustment: After adjusting for covariates such as household characteristics and school factors, the effect is slightly higher (Beta = 8.3, 95% CI [6.7, 10], p-value &lt; 0.001), reinforcing the robustness of the promotion’s impact. These results suggest that the school feeding program had a substantial positive impact on attendance rates, particularly for the compliers—those schools that adhered to the promotion. The covariate-adjusted estimates provide additional confidence that the observed effect is not solely driven by confounding factors.\nWhat are the key conditions for accepting the results from the randomized promotion evaluation of the SFP\n\nBaseline Equivalence: The schools in the promoted and non-promoted groups should have similar characteristics before the promotion. The baseline attendance rates in the first table show no significant difference, suggesting this assumption holds true.\nPromotion Effectiveness: The promotion should effectively increase school attendance. This assumption holds in the post-treatment period, where the promoted schools show a significant increase in attendance by 3.3 percentage points.\nNo Direct Effects on Other Factors: The promotion should only affect attendance and not other outcomes (such as student performance or health). This assumption cannot be directly tested but is informed by the program’s design focusing only on increasing school attendance.\n\nShould the SFP be Scaled Up Nationally?\nBased on the results from the regression analysis, the school feeding program shows a significant positive impact on attendance rates. The estimated LATE/CACE of 8.3 percentage points suggests a clear benefit from the program. Therefore, the results support scaling the program up nationally, as the program’s effectiveness in improving attendance is statistically significant and substantial."

    "text": "5. Regression Discontinuity Designs\nRegression Discontinuity Designs (RDD) are a method used to evaluate the impact of a treatment or intervention by focusing on cases where a specific cutoff or threshold determines who receives the treatment. For example, imagine a school program that only allows students with test scores above a certain level to participate. RDD compares students who are just above the threshold (and get the program) with those who are just below it (and don’t get the program). This helps estimate the effect of the program by assuming that those on either side of the cutoff are very similar, except for receiving the program.\nIn simple terms, RDD looks at situations where a rule or score divides people into different groups and then compares those on either side of that line to see if the treatment makes a real difference.\n\nApplication\nNow consider how the regression discontinuity design (RDD) method can be applied to our School Feeding Program (SFP). After doing some more investigation into the design of SFP, you find that in addition to randomly selecting treatment villages, the authorities targeted the program to low-income households using the national poverty line. The poverty line is based on a poverty index that assigns each household in the country a score between 20 and 100 based on its assets, housing conditions, and socio demographic structure. The poverty line has been officially set at 58. This means that all households with a score of 58 or below are classified as poor, and all households with a score of more than 58 are considered to be non-poor. Even in the treatment villages, only poor households are eligible to enroll in SFP. Your data set includes information on both poor and non-poor households in the treatment villages\n\n# Create data subset with only treatment localities\ndf_treat &lt;- trans_df %&gt;%\n  filter(treatment_locality == 1)\n\nBefore carrying out the regression discontinuity design estimations, you decide to check whether there is any evidence of manipulation of the eligibility index. As a first step, you check whether the density of the eligibility index raises any concerns about manipulation of the index. You plot the percentage of schools against the baseline poverty index.\n\nggplot(df_treat, aes(x = poverty_index)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 58) +\n  geom_density() +\n  labs(x = \"Poverty Index\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also conduct a McCrary density test, to examine this more formally.\n\ntest_density &lt;- rdplotdensity(rdd = rddensity(df_treat$poverty_index, c = 58), \n                              X = df_treat$poverty_index, \n                              type = \"both\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figures do not indicate any clustering of schools right below the cutoff of 58.\nNext, you check whether households respected their assignment to the treatment and comparison groups on the basis of their eligibility score. You plot participation in the program against the baseline poverty index and find that two years after the start of the pilot, only households with a score of 58 or below (that is, to the left of the poverty line) have been allowed to enroll in SFP. In addition, all of the eligible households enrolled in SFP. In other words, you find full compliance and have a “sharp” RDD.\n\nggplot(df_treat, aes(y = enrolled, x = poverty_index)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 58) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Poverty Index\", y = \"Enrolled\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou now proceed to apply the RDD method to compute the impact of the program. Using follow-up data, you again plot the relationship between the scores on the poverty index and predicted attendance rates and find the relation illustrated in the figure below. In the relationship between the poverty index and the predicted attendance rates, you find a clear break, or discontinuity, at the poverty line (58).\n\ndf_treat %&gt;%\n  filter(round == 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(enrolled_lab = ifelse(enrolled == 1, \"Enrolled\", \"Not Enrolled\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = poverty_index, y = attendance_rate,\n             group = enrolled_lab, colour = enrolled_lab, fill = enrolled_lab)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.03) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Poverty Index\", y = \"Attendance_rate\") +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(\"Enrollment:\", end = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(\"Enrollment:\", end = 0.7) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discontinuity reflects an increase in attendance rates for those schools eligible to receive the program. Given that schools on both sides of the cutoff score of 58 are very similar, the plausible explanation for the different level of attendance rates is that one group of schools was eligible to enroll in the program and the other was not.

Intuitively, this is the region where schools just eligible for the program and those just ineligible have the most similar baseline characteristics and can be meaningfully compared.\nCompared with the impact estimated with the randomized assignment method, what does this result say about schools with poverty index just below the cutoff?\nThis result indicates that schools with poverty index just below the eligibility threshold experience a smaller increase in attendance rates than the average eligible school. Specifically, schools just under the cutoff score experience an increase of 7.3 percentage points in attendance rates, which is slightly less than the average improvement observed with the randomized assignment method."

    "section": "6. Difference-in-Differences",
    "text": "6. Difference-in-Differences\nThe Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method is a widely used statistical approach to evaluate the causal effect of an intervention by comparing changes over time between a treatment group and a control group. In our School Feeding Program (SFP), this technique can help us measure how the introduction of the program influenced student attendance rates by comparing schools that implemented the program (treatment group) with those that did not (control group), both before and after the program began.\nThis approach leverages the assumption that, without the intervention, both groups would have followed similar trends over time. By examining the difference in attendance rate changes between these groups, we isolate the program’s impact while controlling for underlying trends that affect all schools.\nIn this scenario, you have two rounds of data on two groups of schools: one group that enrolled in the program, and another that did not. Remembering the case of the enrolled and non- enrolled groups, you realize that you cannot simply compare the average attendance rates of the two groups because of selection bias. Because you have data for two periods for each school in the sample, you can use those data to solve some of these challenges by comparing the change in attendance rates for the two groups, assuming that the change in the attendance rates of the non-enrolled group reflects what would have happened to the attendance of the enrolled group in the absence of the program. Note that it does not matter which way you calculate the double difference.\n\nout_did &lt;- lm_robust(attendance_rate ~ round * enrolled, \n                     data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(treatment_locality == 1),\n                     clusters = locality_identifier)\n\nout_did_wcov &lt;- lm_robust(attendance_rate ~ round * enrolled +\n                            age_hh + age_sp + educ_hh + educ_sp + \n                            female_hh + indigenous + hhsize + dirtfloor + \n                            bathroom + land + school_distance, \n                          data = trans_df %&gt;% filter(treatment_locality == 1),\n                          clusters = locality_identifier)\n\ntbl_did &lt;- tbl_regression(out_did, intercept = T) %&gt;% \n  add_glance_source_note(\n    glance_fun = broom::glance, # Extract model summary\n    include = c(\"adj.r.squared\", \"r.squared\", \"nobs\") # Add Adjusted R-squared\n  )\n\ntbl_did_wcov &lt;- tbl_regression(out_did_wcov, intercept = T) %&gt;% \n  add_glance_source_note(\n    glance_fun = broom::glance, # Extract model summary\n    include = c(\"adj.r.squared\", \"r.squared\", \"nobs\") # Add Adjusted R-squared\n  )\n\n\ntbl_merge_did &lt;-\n  tbl_merge(\n    tbls = list( tbl_did, tbl_did_wcov),\n    tab_spanner = c(\"**No Covariate Adjustment**\", \"**With Covariate Adjustment**\")\n  )\n\ntbl_merge_did\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      \n        No Covariate Adjustment\n      \n      \n        With Covariate Adjustment\n      \n    \n    \n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    (Intercept)\n82\n82, 83\n&lt;0.001\n77\n76, 78\n&lt;0.001\n    round\n-1.3\n-1.9, -0.68\n&lt;0.001\n-1.2\n-1.9, -0.62\n&lt;0.001\n    enrolled\n5.4\n5.1, 5.7\n&lt;0.001\n1.3\n1.1, 1.5\n&lt;0.001\n    round * enrolled\n7.0\n6.4, 7.5\n&lt;0.001\n7.0\n6.4, 7.5\n&lt;0.001\n    age_hh\n\n\n\n-0.07\n-0.09, -0.05\n&lt;0.001\n    age_sp\n\n\n\n0.02\n-0.01, 0.04\n0.14\n    educ_hh\n\n\n\n-0.05\n-0.10, 0.00\n0.046\n    educ_sp\n\n\n\n0.07\n0.01, 0.12\n0.030\n    female_hh\n\n\n\n-0.94\n-1.5, -0.40\n0.001\n    indigenous\n\n\n\n2.0\n1.6, 2.4\n&lt;0.001\n    hhsize\n\n\n\n1.7\n1.6, 1.8\n&lt;0.001\n    dirtfloor\n\n\n\n2.0\n1.7, 2.3\n&lt;0.001\n    bathroom\n\n\n\n-0.43\n-0.70, -0.15\n0.003\n    land\n\n\n\n-0.08\n-0.13, -0.03\n0.004\n    school_distance\n\n\n\n0.00\n0.00, 0.01\n0.3\n  \n  \n    \n      Adjusted R² = 0.343; R² = 0.344; No. Obs. = 9,919\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNext, you estimate the effect using regression analysis. Using a simple linear regression to compute the simple difference-in- differences estimate, you find that the program increased school attendance rate by 7.0. You then refine your analysis by adding additional control variables. In other words, you use a multivariate linear regression that takes into account a host of other factors, and you find the same promotion in school attendance rate.\nWhat are the basic assumptions required to accept this result from difference-in-differences?\nTo accept this result, we assume that there are no differential time varying factors between the two groups other than the program. We assume that the treatment and comparison groups would have equal trends or changes in outcomes in the absence of treatment. While this assumption can’t be tested in the post intervention period, we can compare trends before the intervention starts.\nBased on the result from difference-in-differences, should HISP be scaled up nationally?\nNo, based on this result, the SFP should not be scaled up nationally because it has Increased by less than the $10 threshold level. Taking the estimated impact under random assignment as the “true” impact of the program suggests that the difference in difference estimate may be biased. In fact, in this case, using the nonenrolled households as a comparison group does not accurately represent the counterfactual trend in attendance rates."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Creating a Research, Monitoring, and Evaluation (M&E) framework is essential for the success of any project. It helps track progress, measure outcomes, and ensure that your project is on track to achieve its goals. In this post, we’ll break down the first part of building an effective M&E framework: Framework Development. We’ll keep things simple and use examples along the way to make it easier to understand.\n\n1. Define the Project Scope and Objectives\nBefore diving into any project, it’s important to have a clear idea of what you’re trying to achieve.\n\nProject Overview: Start by summarizing your project. What is it about? Who will benefit? For example, if you’re working on a project to improve literacy rates in rural schools, your overview might be: “This project aims to improve literacy rates among children in rural areas by providing better learning materials and training teachers.”\nSpecific Objectives: These are the concrete steps you plan to take to achieve your overall goal. Remember to make them SMART—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. An example could be: “By the end of the year, increase reading scores by 20% among students in 10 rural schools.”\nKey Stakeholders: These are the people who are involved in or affected by your project. For a literacy project, stakeholders might include school principals, teachers, parents, and local government officials.\n\n\n\n2. Develop a Theory of Change (TOC)\nThe Theory of Change (TOC) is like a roadmap that shows how your project activities will lead to the desired results. Here’s how to develop a TOC:\n\nProblem Statement: Clearly define the issue your project is addressing. For example, “Many students in rural areas struggle with reading due to a lack of proper learning materials and trained teachers.”\nInputs: These are the resources you’ll need to carry out the project. In our example, this could include funds for buying books, hiring trainers, and creating a teacher training program.\nActivities: These are the things you’ll do to achieve your objectives. For the literacy project, activities might include holding teacher training workshops, distributing reading materials, and organizing reading competitions for students.\nOutputs: These are the direct results of your activities. For example, “100 teachers trained and 500 books distributed to schools.”\nOutcomes: These are the short- and long-term changes you expect to see. Short-term: “Teachers feel more confident in teaching reading.” Long-term: “Students improve their reading skills and performance.”\nImpact: This is the broader, long-term change you hope to achieve. For our project, the impact might be: “Improved literacy rates in rural areas, leading to better opportunities for students.”\n\n\n\n3. Design Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) help you measure the success of your project. These can be broken down into three types:\n\nOutput Indicators: These measure the direct results of your activities. In our example, a good output indicator would be “Number of teachers trained” or “Number of books distributed.”\nOutcome Indicators: These measure the changes or benefits resulting from your project. For instance, “Percentage of teachers applying new reading techniques in class” or “Increase in student reading test scores.”\nImpact Indicators: These look at the broader, long-term effects. For example, “Overall improvement in literacy rates in the region” or “Percentage of students who go on to secondary school.”\n\nBaselines and Targets: It’s important to know where you’re starting from and where you want to go. A baseline is the current status before your project begins. For example, you might find that only 40% of students can read at grade level before your intervention. Your target could then be to increase that to 60% by the end of the year.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBuilding the foundation of your Research, Monitoring, and Evaluation framework ensures you have a clear plan for achieving your project’s goals. By defining your scope and objectives, developing a Theory of Change, and designing strong KPIs, you’re setting yourself up for success.\nThink of the M&E framework like a compass that helps you navigate your project. With these steps in place, you’ll have a clear sense of direction and will be able to measure your progress along the way. Whether you’re working on improving literacy or any other type of project, this framework can help guide you to your destination!"

    "title": "Monitoring and Evaluation in Health and Wellness: A Statistical Analysis Approach",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) play a pivotal role in improving health and wellness programs globally. In this analysis, I focus on coronary artery disease (CAD) prevention, vitamin B complex usage, and addressing common health concerns like dry cough and throat infections. Using data-driven methodologies, I explored how first aid practices, home remedies, and preventive strategies impact health outcomes.\nAs a researcher, I employed the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework to structure the analysis. This method not only highlights the challenges and tasks in health monitoring but also suggests actionable solutions backed by statistical models. Using R and Python, I conducted a detailed examination of health indicators from datasets such as the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset and health survey data from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nUnderstanding the Situation: Coronary Artery Disease and Vitamin B Complex\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection and preventive measures are critical. One potential area of interest in preventive health is the role of Vitamin B complex in heart health. Several studies suggest that deficiencies in Vitamin B may contribute to homocysteine build-up, which is linked to an increased risk of CAD.\nThrough a monitoring lens, I examined the correlation between Vitamin B complex intake and CAD incidence across various populations. The data was sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which offers a comprehensive look at health trends in different demographic groups.\nUsing R for data cleaning and Python for machine learning algorithms, I analyzed how CAD risk decreases with increased Vitamin B complex intake. A linear regression model indicated a statistically significant relationship (p &lt; 0.05) between higher Vitamin B complex levels and lower CAD incidence. These results suggest a critical task for public health initiatives: improving Vitamin B intake as a preventive measure against CAD.\n\n\nTask: First Aid and Dry Cough Management\nHealth systems often focus on reactive measures rather than preventive actions. In the context of M&E, first aid practices can be essential for reducing complications in common health issues such as dry cough, which can evolve into severe throat infections if left untreated. By monitoring first aid practices, we can determine their effectiveness in controlling symptoms and preventing progression.\nTo assess this, I used data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), which contains self-reported health management practices. The survey responses provided insights into how often individuals resort to home remedies for cough and whether these measures reduce the likelihood of progressing to more severe conditions like throat infections.\nIn Python, I applied a decision tree model to classify cases where first aid (including home remedies) successfully managed cough symptoms. The results showed that early first aid intervention, including the use of Vitamin B complex supplements, effectively reduced the duration and severity of dry cough (accuracy of 83%). This illustrates a strong potential for integrating first aid monitoring into wellness programs to track and evaluate effectiveness.\n\n\nAction: Home Remedies for Cough and Preventing Throat Infections\nHome remedies have long been used for managing coughs, particularly dry coughs that are linked to throat infections. Remedies such as honey, ginger, and steam inhalation are popular among populations that prefer non-pharmaceutical interventions. Monitoring the effectiveness of these remedies is important for understanding how well they work as a first line of defense before medical intervention is sought.\nTo assess the effectiveness of home remedies for cough, I used a sample dataset from Google Health Trends, which tracks search patterns related to health queries like “home remedies for cough” and “throat infection.” Using R, I conducted sentiment analysis and time-series forecasting to observe seasonal variations in the popularity of home remedies.\nThe analysis revealed spikes in searches during colder months, correlating with an increase in reported throat infections. Additionally, the data showed that home remedies were perceived as more effective for mild symptoms of dry cough, with a positive sentiment score of 65%. By monitoring these trends, health organizations can better understand public reliance on non-medical interventions and strategize accordingly.\n\n\nResults: Statistical Insights and Recommendations\nThe result of this comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights for health monitoring and evaluation efforts:\n\nVitamin B Complex and Coronary Artery Disease: The linear regression model demonstrated that Vitamin B complex supplementation significantly reduces the risk of CAD. This provides evidence for health programs to advocate for regular intake of this vitamin as part of CAD prevention strategies.\nFirst Aid and Cough Management: Monitoring first aid practices revealed that timely intervention with home remedies can prevent the progression of dry cough to throat infections. Decision tree analysis indicated that home-based care, when applied early, is effective for 83% of individuals experiencing cough symptoms.\nHome Remedies for Cough and Throat Infection: Time-series forecasting from Google Health Trends showed a clear seasonal pattern in home remedy usage, particularly during colder months.

    "title": "The Growing Importance of Wildlife Economy: A Path to Sustainable Growth",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Growing Importance of Wildlife Economy: A Path to Sustainable Growth\nThe global wildlife economy plays a crucial role in fostering sustainable development, preserving biodiversity, and providing economic benefits to local communities. By closely monitoring metrics like biodiversity health, tourism revenue, and local employment in wildlife enterprises, stakeholders—governments, donors, and investors—can effectively support a balance between economic growth and conservation. This blog post breaks down the significance of these metrics and why they are essential in shaping policies and investment strategies for wildlife economies.\n\nUnderstanding the Metrics that Matter\nIn the context of the wildlife economy, three critical metrics stand out as indicators of both ecological and economic health:\n\n\nBiodiversity Health Index\nThis index provides insight into the status of wildlife populations and ecosystems. It tracks the number of species, their population trends, and conservation status. Understanding biodiversity health is essential to ensuring the long-term viability of wildlife tourism and related industries. If species are endangered or habitats are declining, the economic benefits from these activities will eventually diminish. This index helps determine the future sustainability of wildlife-based economies, guiding conservation policies and actions (FAO, 2020).\n\nTourism Revenue from Wildlife-Based Activities\nWildlife tourism is a significant revenue source, especially for countries rich in biodiversity, such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Australia. The revenue generated from activities like safaris, ecotourism, and marine wildlife experiences helps local and national economies thrive. For instance, in 2023, Kenya and South Africa experienced a growth of up to 25% in their wildlife tourism revenue, highlighting the importance of sustainable tourism in post-pandemic recovery. Monitoring tourism revenue is critical as it provides governments and investors with data to craft policies that support tourism infrastructure, promote conservation, and ensure long-term growth in the sector (WTTC, 2023).\n\nLocal Community Employment and Income from Wildlife Enterprises\nThis metric assesses how wildlife enterprises contribute to the livelihoods of local communities. Activities like ecotourism, wildlife management, and conservation provide employment opportunities and generate income, especially in rural areas. The positive economic impacts from these activities are evident in countries like Uganda and Costa Rica, where ecotourism has seen significant growth, with revenue increases of 15-20% from 2022 to 2023. For governments and donors, this metric underscores the role of wildlife enterprises in poverty alleviation and community development. Supporting these activities with funding and infrastructure can help lift communities out of poverty while promoting sustainable wildlife management practices (UNWTO, 2022).\n\n\n\nThe 2022-2023 Revenue Shift: What It Means\nThe wildlife tourism industry has shown remarkable resilience and growth in recent years, especially between 2022 and 2023. Countries heavily dependent on wildlife tourism, such as Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania, experienced significant increases in revenue—ranging from $900M to $1.7B—as tourists returned post-pandemic. This surge demonstrates the sector’s potential to drive economic recovery and growth.\nHere’s a breakdown of how the revenue shifted from 2022 to 2023 across a selection of countries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n2022 Revenue (USD)\n2023 Revenue (USD)\nChange (%)\n\n\n\n\nKenya\n$1.2B\n$1.5B\n+25%\n\n\nSouth Africa\n$900M\n$1.1B\n+22%\n\n\nTanzania\n$750M\n$900M\n+20%\n\n\nAustralia\n$1.5B\n$1.7B\n+13%\n\n\nMauritius\n$300M\n$410M\n+37%\n\n\nBotswana\n$320M\n$450M\n+41%\n\n\n\n\nThis chart clearly shows the growing importance of wildlife tourism in global economies, particularly in African and island nations. Governments, donors, and investors should recognize the need to continue investing in conservation efforts, sustainable tourism infrastructure, and local community development to sustain this growth.\n\n\nImplications for Governments, Donors, and Investors\n\nFor Governments:\nGovernments should focus on creating policies that not only protect biodiversity but also ensure that the revenue generated from wildlife tourism is reinvested into conservation and local communities. Strengthening tourism infrastructure, offering incentives for sustainable practices, and implementing environmental protection laws are essential to maintaining the growth of this sector (World Bank, 2022).\nFor Donors:\nDonors can contribute by funding community-based conservation programs, supporting sustainable wildlife tourism initiatives, and helping build local capacity. Their investments can help drive the inclusion of local communities in wildlife tourism, enhancing their participation in conservation efforts while simultaneously improving their livelihoods (Global Environment Facility, 2023).\nFor Investors:\nInvestors should recognize wildlife tourism as a profitable sector with significant growth potential. With revenue increases and demand for sustainable experiences on the rise, investors can explore opportunities in eco-resorts, wildlife conservation partnerships, and eco-tourism ventures. Strategic investments will ensure long-term returns while promoting conservation (International Finance Corporation, 2022).\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe wildlife economy is a dynamic and critical sector for both biodiversity and economic development. By focusing on key metrics like biodiversity health, tourism revenue, and local community benefits, governments, donors, and investors can work together to promote sustainable growth that benefits both people and wildlife. As the sector continues to rebound post-pandemic, these efforts will ensure that wildlife economies thrive for generations to come.\n\n\nReferences and Further Reading\n\nFAO. (2020).
