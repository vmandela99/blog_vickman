# 1. Introduction to CAPI and SurveyCTO

**What is CAPI?** Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) is a method where interviewers use electronic devices (like tablets or smartphones) to conduct surveys. Instead of paper forms, they enter responses directly into software, making data collection faster and more efficient.

**Example**: Imagine a team conducting a health survey in a rural area. Using CAPI, an interviewer can walk into a household with a tablet, ask questions about family health practices, and record the answers on the spot, eliminating the need for paper forms.

**Why Use CAPI?**

-   **Efficiency**: CAPI allows real-time data entry, reducing errors and speeding up the collection process.

-   **Flexibility**: Interviewers can easily navigate between questions based on previous answers.

-   **Data Quality**: Immediate validation checks help ensure that the data collected is accurate.

**Example**: If a respondent indicates that they have a chronic illness, the CAPI system can automatically trigger additional questions related to treatment and management, ensuring comprehensive data collection.

**What is SurveyCTO?** SurveyCTO is a powerful tool for designing and implementing CAPI surveys. It provides a user-friendly interface, allowing researchers to create surveys without needing advanced technical skills.

### 2. Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up CAPI with SurveyCTO

**Step 1: Create a Survey Account** Start by signing up for a SurveyCTO account. The platform offers a free trial, which is great for getting familiar with its features.

**Example**: Go to the SurveyCTO website, click "Sign Up," and fill in your details. You can explore the dashboard to see various options available.

**Step 2: Design Your Survey**

-   **Use the Form Designer**: Create questions using different types (e.g., multiple choice, text, rating scales).

    **Example**: If you’re surveying about dietary habits, you might include a multiple-choice question: "What is your primary source of protein?" with options like "Meat," "Fish," "Beans," and "Nuts."

-   **Add Logic**: Use branching logic to direct respondents based on their answers. For instance, if a respondent answers "yes" to "Do you eat fish regularly?" you can automatically show them a follow-up question about their preferred types of fish.

**Step 3: Test Your Survey** Before launching, test your survey to catch any errors. Use the preview feature to see how the survey will look on mobile devices.

**Example**: Conduct a test run with a colleague to identify any confusing questions or technical issues. Make necessary adjustments based on their feedback.

**Step 4: Deploy Your Survey** Once everything looks good, deploy your survey to field workers. They can download it to their devices and start collecting data!

**Example**: If your team is conducting a survey on education, field workers can download the survey onto their tablets and head to schools to gather data from students and teachers.

### 3. Best Practices for Designing Survey Instruments

**1. Keep It Simple** Use clear and concise language. Avoid jargon and complex terms. Make sure respondents understand the questions easily.

**Example**: Instead of asking, "How often do you engage in physical activity?" consider rephrasing it to "How many days a week do you exercise?"

**2. Limit the Length** Shorter surveys tend to have higher completion rates. Aim for around 10-15 minutes of survey time.

**Example**: If you’re gathering feedback on a community program, keep your survey to 10 questions to encourage more respondents to complete it.

**3. Use a Mix of Question Types** Combine different types of questions to keep the survey engaging. Use multiple-choice questions for quick answers and open-ended questions for more detailed feedback.

**Example**: After a multiple-choice question about preferred community services, include an open-ended question like "What other services would you like to see in the community?"

**4. Pilot Your Survey** Before rolling it out to everyone, conduct a pilot test with a small group. Gather feedback on clarity and user experience, and make necessary adjustments.

**Example**: If you’re surveying urban residents, test your survey with a small group from different neighborhoods to ensure the questions resonate with diverse perspectives.

**5. Think About Mobile Use** Since CAPI is conducted on mobile devices, design your survey to be mobile-friendly. Ensure buttons are large enough to click, and text is readable on small screens.

**Example**: Use larger fonts and clear buttons for answering questions to make navigation easy for interviewers in the field, especially when using tablets in bright sunlight.

**Conclusion** CAPI and SurveyCTO provide researchers with an innovative and efficient way to collect data. By understanding the basics and following best practices, you can create effective surveys that yield high-quality data. In the next posts, we’ll dive deeper into data collection strategies and how to manage the information you gather. Stay tuned!
