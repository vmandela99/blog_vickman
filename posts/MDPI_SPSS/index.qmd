# A Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Using SPSS

In poverty research, the **Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)** is a crucial tool for measuring poverty beyond income, capturing deprivations across multiple dimensions such as education and living standards. This blog outlines the exact **SPSS code** to compute MPI using specific survey indicators.

Let’s break down the process step by step:

### **Step 1: Compute the MPI Indicators**

MPI is calculated based on **two dimensions**—**Education** and **Living Standards**—with specific indicators for each. Here's how you can compute the binary deprivation indicators for each component:

#### **Education Indicators (Weight: 1/4 for each)**

1.  **Years of Schooling Completed**\
    `COMPUTE FIVE_YRS_SCHOOLING_COMPLETED = Q403b < 5.`

2.  **School-Aged Child Enrollment**\
    `COMPUTE SCHOOL_AGED_CHILD_NOT_ENROLLED_IN_SCHOOL = Q404 = 1.`

#### **Living Standards Indicators (Weight: 1/12 for each)**

1.  **No Electricity**\
    `COMPUTE No_electricity = Q409_1 = 0.`

2.  **Access to Clean Drinking Water**\
    `COMPUTE ACCESS_TO_CLEAN_DRINKING_WATER = Q410 = 6 | Q410 = 7 | Q410 = 8 | Q410 = 10 | Q410 = 11 | Q410 = 12.`

3.  **Access to Improved Sanitation**\
    `COMPUTE ACCESS_TO_IMPROVED_SANITATION = Q413 = 10 | Q413 = 11 | Q413 = 12 | Q413 = 13.`

4.  **Dirt Floor**\
    `COMPUTE DIRT_FLOOR = Q407 = 1 | Q407 = 2.`

5.  **Dirty Cooking Fuel**\
    `COMPUTE DIRTY_COOKING_FUEL = Q412 = 7 | Q412 = 8 | Q412 = 9 | Q412 = 10 | Q412 = 11 | Q412 = 12.`

6.  **Asset Holding**\
    `COMPUTE ASSET_HOLDING = (Q409_2 = 0 & Q409_3 = 0 & Q409_4 = 0 & Q409_6 = 0 & Q409_7 = 0 & Q409_8 = 0 & Q409_9 = 0) & (Q409_11 = 0 | Q409_12 = 0).`

### **Step 2: Weighting the Indicators**

After computing the individual indicators, apply the appropriate weights:

-   Education Indicators: Weight = **1/4**

-   Living Standard Indicators: Weight = **1/12**

Example for the **Years of Schooling Completed**:\
`COMPUTE FIVE_YRS_SCHOOLING_COMPLETED_weighted = FIVE_YRS_SCHOOLING_COMPLETED * EDUCATION_WGHT.`

Similarly, compute the weighted versions of all other indicators for education and living standards.

### **Step 3: Calculate the Deprivation Score**

The deprivation score is a sum of the weighted indicators, with scores ranging from **0 to 1**, where **1** represents the highest deprivation.\
Syntax:\
`COMPUTE DEPRIVATION_SCORE = FIVE_YRS_SCHOOLING_COMPLETED_weighted + SCHOOL_AGED_CHILD_NOT_ENROLLED_IN_SCHOOL_weighted + No_electricity_WEIGHTED + ACCESS_TO_CLEAN_DRINKING_WATER_weighted + ACCESS_TO_IMPROVED_SANITATION_weighted + DIRT_FLOOR_weighted + DIRTY_COOKING_FUEL_weighted + ASSET_HOLDING_WEIGHTED.`

### **Step 4: MPI Classification**

Finally, classify households based on their deprivation scores:

-   **Non-Poor**: 0-0.19

-   **Vulnerable to Poverty**: 0.20-0.33

-   **Multidimensionally Poor**: 0.34-0.50

-   **Severely Poor**: 0.51+

Syntax:\
`RECODE DEPRIVATION_SCORE (0 thru 0.1999=1) (0.2000 thru 0.3333=2) (0.3334 thru 0.5000=3) (0.5001 thru Highest=4) INTO MPI_POVERTY_STATUS2.`

### **Conclusion**

By following these steps and using the corresponding SPSS code, you can efficiently compute the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and gain meaningful insights into poverty beyond income-based measures.

MPI helps identify vulnerable populations, prioritize areas of intervention, and assess the overall well-being of households. If you're interested in further understanding poverty data and the SPSS process, this guide serves as a comprehensive starting point!
