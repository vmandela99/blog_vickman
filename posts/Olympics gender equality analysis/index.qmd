**Olympic Movement: Achievements in gender equality**

-   **Paris 1900:** Female athletes first took part in the Olympic Games, four years after the first modern Olympics took place in Athens

-   **1996**: Promotion of women becomes a mission of the IOC and is enshrined in the Olympic Charter

-   **Tokyo 2020**: The last edition of the Games were the most gender-balanced to date with 48.7 per cent of athletes women. At Tokyo 1964, only 13 per cent of the athletes were women.

-   **Tokyo 2020**: Following a rule change allowing one male and one female athlete to jointly carry their flag during the Opening Ceremony, 91 per cent of NOCs had a female flag bearer

-   **Tokyo 2020**: Three disciplines achieved gender balance (BMX racing, mountain biking and freestyle wrestling)
